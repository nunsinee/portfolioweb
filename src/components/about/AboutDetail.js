				Hi, I am <b>Nunsinee Viken</b> and I currently studying
				front-end web development at NOROFF and I am looking for an
				opportunity to start work as a front-end web developer.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have previously worked as IT support/computer support and I
				have some previous experiences in making websites with
				Dreamweaver, photoshop and Wordpress. I also have experience in
				updating news online, as well as designing web pages for
				statistics. After this I changed to work in the tourism industry
				in my native country.
			</p>
			<p>
				After moving to Norway in 2018, I decided to study in front-end
				development to improve my skills and knowledges as I would like
				to continue working with development of web sites.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am open-mind, multilingual, hardworking and find it easy to
				adopt to new environments, therefore I believe I would be an
				asset for those offering me the opportunity to grow with them.
				Please feel free to contact me to get to know me even more.
			</p>
